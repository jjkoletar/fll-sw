    <h1>FLL Software</h1>

    <p>This is the home of the First Lego League (FLL) software.  Currently
    the only software is for scoring and display during tournaments.  This
    software has been written by individuals in Minnesota and has been used
    extensively there.</p>

    <p>Partners known to be running the software include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Minnesota</li>
      <li>Illinois</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are using the software for your tournaments, please let me
    know so that I can add to this list.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Here are the <a href="setup.html">setup instructions</a>.  This includes the hardware and software for tournaments of different sizes.</li>

      <li>You can also get a look at the <a
      href="instructions.html">instructions for running the software</a>.
      Most of the links on this page are dead because this page is really
      just one of the pages from the actual software install, but you can
      get a good idea of how things are to run from it.</li>

      <li>The SourceForge project page is <a
      href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/fll-sw">here</a>.  You can
      find the source code and the releases there as well as a list of
      issues (bugs/todos).</li>

      <li>For an explanation of how the scores are totaled up read <a
      href="ScoreExplaination.pdf">this document</a></li>

      <li>You can see some screenshots of the system <a
      href="http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=76410">here</a></li>

      <li>Features:
        <ul>
          <li>Open Source Software</li>
          
          <li>Freely distributable</li>
          
          <li>Platform Independent (written in Java)</li>
          
          <li>Scalable - Successfully used in tournaments with 16 to 80
          teams</li>
          
          <li>Easy to use web interface</li>
          
          <li>Allows hierarchical tournament structure to do tournament
          advancement from regional tournaments to state and beyond</li>
          
          <li>Easy to configure for different tournaments with a simple XML
          file, no code changes required</li>
          
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Descriptions of the design
        <ul>
          <li>Why is the subjective scoring application a separate app
          rather than a web pased app?  This is done because at many of our
          tournaments in the beginning we entered the subjective scores
          down at the location of the subjective judging and the network is
          in the performance area which is not close enough to network to
          the subjective judging area.  We still run our state tournament
          this way, although most of our regionals aren't run this
          way.</li>
          
          <li>We used Java when writing the application because it is a
          language that we're familiar with and a number of other people
          know as well to help develop.  We also needed a language that is
          capable of doing SQL processing and a fair amount of math.  We
          also wanted a language that is platform independent so we can run
          on both Windows and Linux.</li>
          
          <li>We made the application web-based as it's mostly just a bunch
          of forms without much need for user interaction and this makes it
          easy to use other devices for clients to enter scores in the
          future.</li>
          
          <li>The software is web-based, but not internet-based because
          most of our sites do not have a readily accessible internet
          connection.</li>
          
          <li>We are using the database <a
          href='http://www.hsqldb.org'>HSQL</a> because it is a pure Java
          SQL database that can be run in memory.  This makes it easier to
          install the software as another installer doesn't need to be run.
          We started with Access and moved off of that because it's
          Microsoft only and we wanted a database that is more robust.
          MySQL was used after that as it runs on Windows and Linux,
          however it still needs a separate installer.</li>
            
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Future plans:
        <ul>
          <li>Currently the install takes more time than I'd like.  The next step is to have the install be 1 zip file.  This release should be out late spring to early summer 2006</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      
    </ul>
