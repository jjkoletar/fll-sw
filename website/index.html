    <h1>FLL Software</h1>

    <p>This is the home of the First Lego League (FLL) software.  Currently
    the only software is for scoring and display during tournaments.  This
    software has been written by individuals in Minnesota and has been used
    extensively there.</p>

    <p>Partners known to be running the software include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Minnesota</li>
      <li>Illinois</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are using the software for your tournaments, please let me
    know so that I can add to this list.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Here are the <a href="setup.html">setup instructions</a>.  This includes the hardware and software for tournaments of different sizes.</li>

      <li>You can also get a look at the <a href="instructions.html">instructions for running the software</a>.  Most of the links on this page are dead because this page is really just one of the pages from the actual software install, but you can get a good idea of how things are to run from it.</li>

      <li>The SourceForge project page is <a
      href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/fll-sw">here</a>.  You can
      find the source code and the releases there as well as a list of
      issues (bugs/todos).</li>

      <li>For an explanation of how the scores are totaled up read <a
      href="ScoreExplaination.pdf">this document</a></li>

      <li>You can see some screenshots of the system <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=76410">here</a></li>

      <li>Features:
        <ul>
          <li>Open Source Software</li>
          <li>Freely distributable</li>
          <li>Platform Independent (written in Java)</li>
          <li>Scalable - Successfully used in tournaments with 16 to 80 teams</li>
          <li>Easy to use web interface</li>
          <li>Allows hierarchical tournament structure to do tournament advancement from regional tournaments to state and beyond</li>
          <li>Easy to configure for different tournaments with a simple XML file, no code changes required</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Future plans:
        <ul>
          <li>Currently the install takes more time than I'd like.  The next step is to have the install be 1 zip file.  This release should be out late spring to early summer 2006</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      
    </ul>
