    <h1>FLL Software</h1>

    <p>This is the home of the First Lego League (FLL) software.  Currently
    the only software is for scoring and display during tournaments.  This
    software has been written by individuals in Minnesota and has been used
    extensively there.</p>

    <p>States/countries know to be running the software include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Minnesota</li>
      <li>Illinois</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are using the software for your tournaments, please let me
    know so that I can add to this list.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Here are the <a href="setup.html">setup instructions</a>.  This includes the hardware and software for tournaments of different sizes.</li>

      <li>You can also get a look at the <a href="instructions.html">instructions for running the software</a>.  Most of the links on this page are dead because this page is really just one of the pages from the actual software install, but you can get a good idea of how things are to run from it.</li>
    </ul>
