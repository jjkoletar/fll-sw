	* src/fll/gui/SubjectiveFrame.java (SubjectiveFrame): When
	switching score categories, make sure to tell the table to stop
	editing a cell, if it is.  This keeps one from losing data when

	* src/fll/web/admin/Tournaments.java (verifyData): Allow one to

	before committing it to the database.

	correct one is always deployed.  Cleaned up javadoc target.

2003-04-20  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@mtu.net>
