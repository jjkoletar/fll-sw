/* CSS file for the challenge.xml file.
   
   Just playing around with CSS files as applied directly to XML
   for formatting in a browser.   

   NOTE: at this time, only Mozilla 1.0 and perhaps Opera support all
         the CSS extensions (mostly CSS2 stuff) that is needed in here;
         MS InternetExplorer 6.0 does not.
