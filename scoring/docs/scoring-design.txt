Notes on scoring redesign.

A tournament has categories

A category has missions
A category has a name
A category has a title

A mission has goals
A mission has a title
A mission is completed or not completed
  This is computed based on it's goals and other missions
A mission may has a point value (default 0, use the goals instead)
  The point value of the mission is added in if the mission is completed

A goal has a title
A goal has a name
A goal has a multiplier (default 1)
A goal has a score

An enumerated goal has enum values
Each enum value has a score (may not be unique within the goal)

A simple goal has a min and a max


The computation of the score needs to be modularized so that it's only
written once inside the code.
